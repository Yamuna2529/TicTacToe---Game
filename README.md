# ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe Game (Java)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The **Tic Tac Toe Game** is a console-based/GUI-based (choose one) project developed using **Core Java**.  
This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, **conditional logic**, and **2D array handling** to build an interactive and fun two-player game.

Itâ€™s a simple yet effective project that highlights problem-solving and Java programming skills.

## ðŸ§  Game Logic
1. The game board is represented as a **3x3 matrix**.  
2. Players take turns marking â€˜Xâ€™ and â€˜Oâ€™ in empty cells.  
3. After each move, the program checks all possible win conditions (rows, columns, diagonals).  
4. If one player wins, a message is displayed; otherwise, if all cells are filled, it declares a draw.  
5. Option to restart the game.
